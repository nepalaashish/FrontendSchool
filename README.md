# FrontendSchool


This is the frontend part made my me for school app using react js . 
   In this react app , I have done all requirment needed for running a school app 
    In navbar you can see a teacher route to go to teacher list 
    Along with that three types of login  
       1) Teacher login ( teacher can update his profile , and can see all the message droped by student)
       
       2) Admin login ( Admoin login can add teacher and student and see the both list )
       
       
       3) Student login ( student Can drop the message for teacher and apply for leave )
